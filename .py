# Question one: Write a python program to display the sum of even numbers less than
even_numbers_less_than_8= (2,4,6)
sum_of_even_numbers = (2+4+6)
print(sum_of_even_numbers)

# Question two: Write a program in python to input 5 numbers from the keyboard and find their average
a = 1
b = 2
c = 3
d = 4
e = 5
total_number = (a + b + c + d + e)
print(total_number)
average = (total_number)/5
print(type(average))
print("The average is; "+ str(average))

# Question three: Write a python program to print the output of the following operations

# -5 + 8 * 6
result = (-5+8*6)
print(result)

# (55+9)%9
result = (55+9)%9
print(result)


#20 + -3 * 5/8
result = (20+-3*5/8)
print(result)

# 5 + 15/3 * 2-8%3
result = (5+15/3*2-8%3)
print(result)
